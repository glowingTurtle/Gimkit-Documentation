# Gimkit Documentation
Modular Gimkit tutorial program, from basic functionalities to advanced concepts. Community project. 
# About
Gimprint was designed to teach anyone how to use Gimkit Creative. The idea was- and always has been- to make the process as simple and easy as possible. Therefore, you'll never have to download anything, add an extension to your browser, or even use inspect element. Due to URL limits and by design, each tutorial comes in its own modular bookmarklet. All you'll ever have to do is copy and paste. It's coded by the Gimkit Creative user @Turtle, and written by many different people in the community. The credits will be added to each module once they are written.

# Community
This is an ongoing project and it likely will be for a while. If you think you're qualified to write a module, reach out on the Gimkit Creative Forums. There are more tutorials that aren't listed here yet as well. Any ideas are appreciated. 

If you do write a tutorial, make sure you're okay with your writing being used by anyone. See the MIT License for more information on that. 

# Disclaimer
This sort of goes without saying, but obviously this is not an official Gimkit project. The Gimkit team does not endorse and did not create this project, and this is a community project.
